I love playing with new tech and reading up on the latest trends in the market. Although I've been developing desktop applications from the start of my career until now, I have always had an interest in web development. I'm currently studying on Udemy and also experimenting with technologies like Javascript, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Bootstrap, Typescript, React.js. I also build wordpress websites for small companies after hours, just to get some exposure to real life web projects.",
